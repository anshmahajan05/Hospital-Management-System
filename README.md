The proposed Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based solution aimed at enhancing the efficiency of hospital operations by digitalizing core processes. This system enables hospital staff to register patients, book appointments, and manage schedules seamlessly. Admins are provided with robust tools to oversee doctor schedules, update records, and generate detailed reports, ensuring smooth hospital management. Doctors can maintain their schedules, manage appointments, and recommend tests and medications directly through the system. By integrating these functionalities into a single platform, the HMS streamlines communication and coordination within the hospital, ultimately improving patient care and administrative efficiency.
